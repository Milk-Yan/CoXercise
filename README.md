# CoXercise

CoXercise is a research honours project to investigate the effects of collaboration on exergames.
<insert paper link here if we ever publish it>
  
ExerQuest is the game we made to accomplish this. It is a simple exergame with a warrior, necromancer, and priest that work together to defeat the big skeleton boss. You need to walk and turn in real life to play the game. There are singleplayer and multiplayer versions, and the multiplayer version is currently hosted and playable, albeit with a small lag. Below is the video link of some demo plays:

As this was a very time-constrained research university project, please understand that there are quite a lot of items that may need fixing/improving here. We're happy to review any pull requests and we hope you have a fun time with the game as much as we do!
